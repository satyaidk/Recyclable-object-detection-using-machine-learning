# Recyclable object detection using Machine Learning!

**Recyclable Object Detection Using Machine Learning** is a transformative approach to waste management and environmental sustainability. By leveraging computer vision and classification algorithms, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Random Forest classifiers, this method enables systems to identify and sort recyclable materials from waste streams automatically. Using labeled datasets of objects like plastics, metals, paper, and non-recyclable waste, machine learning models can be trained to achieve high accuracy in detection and categorization. This innovation not only streamlines recycling processes but also reduces human error and increases overall efficiency, contributing to a cleaner and greener planet.
